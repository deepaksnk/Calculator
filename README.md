# Calculator

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the **Calculator Project**, implemented in both Flowgorithm and C programming language. Both versions include comprehensive functionality for performing various mathematical operations, with the Flowgorithm version providing a flowchart-based interface and the C version offering a command-line application.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Advanced operations: trigonometric functions
- Matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinants, and transposition
- Vector operations: addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, and angle calculation
- Complex number operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Fraction operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- User-friendly interfaces (Flowchart in Flowgorithm and command-line in C)
- Error handling for invalid inputs and divide-by-zero scenarios
